* Quick Feature Overview

Treemacs is a file and project explorer in the same vein as NeoTree or vim's NerdTree. It shows the file system outline in a
simple tree layout allowing quick navigation and exploration, while also possessing *basic* file management utilities.
Specifically a quick feature overview looks as follows:

 * Easy navigation - quickly change the root directory or use shortcuts to jump to parent or neighbouring nodes.
 * Versatile file access - decide exactly how and where a file will be opened, including using ~ace-window~ to choose
   a buffer or launch an external app via ~xdg-open~
 * Optionally always follow along and keep in focus the currently selected file ~treemacs-follow-mode~
 * Optional git integration - treemacs will use different faces for files based on their git status.
   The git process runs asynchronously and so won't cause any perceptible delay.
 * [[https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum][Winum]] integration - treemacs will always be assigned window number 10, never interfering with the numbering
   layout of your other windows.
 * Projectile integration - quickly open treemacs at any known project's root directory.
 * (Limimted) mouse interface - you can close/expand folders and open files by left-clicking on icons.
 * Dashing good looks - treemacs uses genuine png images in HD 22x22 resolution for its icons (quantity is, of course,
   another matter). When run in a terminal a very simple fallback is used.
 * Session persistence with ~desktop-save-mode~
 * *(Early Beta)* Treemacs is able to display files' tags. All file types that emacs can generate a (semantic) imenu
   index for are supported.
 * Ease of use - treemacs offers many configuration options, but comes with a set of (what hopefully should be) sane
   defaults. Installation aside there are two obligatory pieces of setup: 1) Choosing convenient keybindings to run
   treemacs and 2) If you use evil: requiring ~treemacs-evil~ to integrate treemacs with evil and enable j/k navigation.
   More on both below.

* Quick Start
If you don't care about reading the full readme here's a list of some bare bones basics to get you started:
 * If you use evil don't forget to also install ~treemacs-evil~
 * Treemacs doesn' bind any global keys, you need to use whatever fits you best. A basic install setup for
   spacemacs can be found [[#installation][below]]. Otherwise just bind ~treemacs~, ~treemacs-toggle~ and ~treemacs-projectile~.
 * For navigation use n/p (j/k when evil), M-n/M-p to move to same-height neighbour u to go to parent, h to
   move up a dir, l to move root to selected dir
 * TAB always opens and closes nodes. Files can be opened, too - treemacs will show their imenu index.
 * There's half a dozen different ways to open nodes, all bound under o as prefix. Pick your favourite.
 * RET runs a default action, configurable to your tastes under ~treemacs-default-actions~
* Detailed Feature List
** Treemacs-follow-mode

~treemacs-follow-mode~ is a minor mode which allows the treemacs view to always move its focus to the
currently selected file. This is achieved by advising ~select-window~, which is a ubiquitous function, often called
multiple times in a row when emacs is working. This means two things:

1) ~treemacs-follow~ tries to be very specific about when it is run at all.

2) There may be times when something slips through (~which-key~ for exmaple would cause such a problem if treemacs
wasn't made compatible with it by default). If you do see ~treemacs-follow~ behaving in a way it shouldn't open up
an issue. The fix shouldn't be more than a single bit of advice away.

** Treemacs-filewatch-mode

~treemacs-filewatch-mode~ is a minor mode which enables treemacs to watch the files it is displaying for changes
and automatically refresh itself by means of ~treemacs-refresh~ when it detects a change that it decides is relevant.

A file event is relevant for treemacs if a new file has been created or deleted or a file has been changed and
~treemacs-git-integration~ is t. Events caused by files that are ignored as per ~treemacs-ignored-file-predicates~
are likewise counted as not relevant.

The refresh is not called immediately after an event was received, treemacs instead waits ~treemacs-file-event-delay~
ms to see if any more files have changed to avoid having to refresh multiple times over a short period of time. If
the treemacs buffer exists, but is not visible, a refresh will be run the next time it is shown.

The change only applies to directories opened *after* this mode has been activated. This means that to enable file
watching in an already existing treemacs buffer it needs to be torn down and rebuilt by calling ~treemacs~ or
~treemacs-projectile~.

Turning off this mode is, on the other hand, instantaneous - it will immediately turn off all existing file watch
processes and outstanding refresh actions.

_Known limitations_:
Staging and comitting changes does not produce any file change events of its own, if you use ~treemacs-git-integration~
you still need to do a manual refresh to see your files' face go from 'changed' and 'untracked' to 'unchanged' after a commit.

** Session persistence
To persist treemacs state beyond emacs' shutdown treemacs offers integration with the builtin
~desktop-save-mode~. This integration shoud work out of the box and require zero setup and configuration
(aside from the option to turn it off with ~treemacs-never-persist~).

The persisted state is saved under ~user-emacs-directory/.cache/treemacs-persist~. The exact file location
is saved in the variable ~treemacs--persist-file~.

Persistence by means of frameworks other than ~desktop-save-mode~ is likewise possible, but does require
some additional work. To save treemacs' current state ~treemacs-persist~ must be called. By default this would
happen in ~desktop-save-hook~, in its absence it must be invoked elsewhere. If all else fails ~emacs-kill-hook~
is a good candidate to run persistence.

State restoration should again work automatically. When the treemacs major mode is toggled in a completely empty
buffer (this should normally never happen, as even an empty directory still contains a header) ~treemacs-restore~
will be called and the previously saved state (if available) will be restored. If this does not work it is of course
still possible to invoke ~treemacs-restore~ manually when the right conditions are met.
** Terminal Compatibility
When run in a terminal treemacs will fall back to a much simpler rendering system, foregoing its usual png icons and using
simple ~+~ and ~-~ characters instead. Changes to the current rendering system are detected automatically - within some
limits. The check for the change happens with treemacs' functions which build or show/hide the treemacs buffer, namely
~treemacs(-projectile)~. ~treemacs-toggle~ and ~treemacs-refresh~.

** Tag View
Treemacs is able to display not only the file system, but also tags found in individual files. The tags list is sourced
using emacs' builtin imenu functionality, so all file types that emacs can generate an imenu index for are supported.
Imenu cachses its result, so to avoid stale tag lists setting ~imenu-auto-rescan~ to t is recommended. Tags generated
with the help of ~semantic-mode~ are likewise supported.

Tag view support is in an early beta release stage, and so (other than the increased likelyhood of bugs), it's currently
missing certain features:

 * It won't look right in the terminal, there arent't any terminal icons for tags yet.
* Installation

Treemacs is available from MELPA. If you just want to quickly start using it you grab use the following ~use-package~
example, and customize it as needed (remove ~treemacs-evil~ if you don't use it, use another map for keybinds if you
don't use spacemacs etc).

Either way keep in mind that treemacs has /no default keybinds/ for its globally callable initialization functions.
Each user is supposed to select keybinds for functions like ~treemacs~, ~treemacs-projectile~ and ~treemacs-toggle~
based on whatever they find convenient.

You can find an exhaustive overview of all functions, their keybinds and functions you need to bind yourself [[#keymap][below]].

Ignored files will *never* be shown in the treemacs buffer (unlike dotfiles) whose presence is controlled by ~treemacs-show-hidden-files~). Each predicate is a function that takes the filename as its only argument and returns t if the file should be ignored and nil otherwise. A file whose name returns t for *any* function in this list counts as ignored. By default this list contains ~treemacs--std-ignore-file-predicate~ which filters out '.', '..', Emacs' lock files as well as flycheck's temp files, and therefore should not be directly overwritten, but added to and removed from instead.               |

The tags in the treemacs view store their position as markers pointing to a buffer. If that buffer is killed, or has never really been open, as treemacs kills buffer after fetching their tags if they did no exist before, the stored positions become stale, and treemacs needs to use a different method to move to that tag. This variale sets that method. Its possible values are: ~refetch-index~: Call up the file's imenu index again and use its information to jump. ~call-xref~: Call ~xref-find-definitions~ to find the tag. ~issue-warning~: Just issue a warning that the tag's position pointer is invalid. |
| treemacs-default-actions            | Open/close dirs & tag sections, `treemacs-visit-node-no-split' for files & tags | Defines the behaviour of `treemacs-visit-node-default-action'. Each alist element maps from a button state to the function that should be used for that state. The list of all possible button states is defined in `treemacs-valid-button-states'. Possible values are all treemacs-visit-node-* functions as well as `treemacs-push-button' for simple open/close actions. To keep the alist clean changes should not be made directly, but with `treemacs-define-default-action'.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

** Faces

|-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| treemacs-directory-face | font-lock-function-name-face                    | Face used for directories.                                                   |
| treemacs-file-face      | default                                         | Face used for files.                                                         |
| treemacs-header-face    | font-lock-constant-face (underlined & size 1.4) | Face used for the treemacs header.                                           |
| treemacs-term-node-face | font-lock-string-face                           | Face for directory node symbols used by treemacs when it runs in a terminal. |
| treemacs-git-*-face     | various font lock faces                         | Faces used by treemacs for various git states.                               |

** Evil compatibility
To make treemacs get along with evil-mode you need to install and load ~treemacs-evil~. It does not define any functions
or offer any configuration options, making sure it is loaded is sufficient.

** Custom Icons
If you have an icon you'd like to make use of in treemacs my preferred solution is very much
for you to open a pull request (adding a new icon is a one-liner in treemacs-visuals.el) or an issue
to let me know about a good icon I can add.

If that's not possible or if you'd like to use something like ~all-the-icons.el~ (which isn't used by default
treemacs due to iconic fonts not being monospaced) treemacs offers the option to quickly define custom icons
using the ~treemacs-define-custom-icon~ function.

It takes as its arguments an icon (a string) and a list of file extension to use the icon for. Already present
icons for these extensions will be overwritten. The extensions are not case-sensitive and will be dowcased.

Note that treemacs has a very loose definition of what constitutes a file extension - it's either everything
past the last period, or just the file's full name if there is no period. This makes it possible to match file
names like '.gitignore' and 'Makefile'.

Example usage would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (defvar treemacs-custom-html-icon (all-the-icons-icon-for-file "file.html"))
    (treemacs-define-custom-icon treemacs-custom-html-icon "html" "htm"))
#+END_SRC

** Custom header function

The function which creates the header in treemacs is easily replaced (see the entry for ~treemacs-header-function~ in the
section about [[#variables][configuration variables]] for details). To use your own custom header you just need to define a function that
formats the header as you wish and then tell treemacs to use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun treemacs-header-with-brackets (current-root)
    (format "<%s>" (file-name-nondirectory current-root)))
  (setq treemacs-header-function #'treemacs-header-with-brackets)
#+END_SRC

* Keymap
** Unbound functions
These functions are not bound to any keys by default. It's left up to users to find the most convenient key binds.
Additionally ~treemacs-refresh~, ~treemacs-select-window~ and ~treemacs-find-file~ may also be called from outside
the treemacs window and might therefore need their own global binding.
