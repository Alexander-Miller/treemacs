* Quick Feature Overview
Treemacs is a file and project explorer similar to NeoTree or vim's NerdTree, but largely inspired by the Project
Explorer in Eclipse. It shows the file system outlines of your projects in a simple tree layout allowing quick
navigation and exploration, while also possessing *basic* file management utilities. Specifically a quick feature
overview looks as follows:

 * Project management :: Treemacs lets you view multiple file trees - projects - at once and quickly add or remove them.
 * Easy navigation :: quickly move between projects or use shortcuts to jump to parent or neighbouring nodes.
 * Versatile file access :: decide exactly how and where a file will be opened, including using ~ace-window~ to choose
   a window or launching an external application.
 * Understanding of frames :: every frame will receive its own treemacs buffer that will live and die with that frame.
 * Finding of files and tags :: Treemacs can follow along and keep in focus the currently selected file or even the tag
   at point using, either manually or automatically using either ~treemacs-follow-mode~ or ~treemacs-tag-follow-mode~.
 * Git Integration :: Treemacs can use different faces for files and directories based on their git status.
   The git process is run asynchronously, minimizing its performanace impact.
 * [[https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum][Winum]] compatibility :: treemacs will not interfere with winum's numbering layout, your first window will always remain
   your first window.
 * [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] integration :: the ~treemacs-projectile~ package lets you quickly add your projectle projects to the
   treemacs workspace.
 * Simple mouse interface :: Left clicks will work the same as you're used to from with graphical applications
 * Session persistence :: Treemacs automatically saves and restores your workspace.
 * Dashing good looks :: Treemacs uses genuine png images in HD 22x22 resolution for its icons (quantity is, of course,
   another matter). When run in a terminal a simple fallback is used.
 * Tag view :: Treemacs can display files' tags. All file types that emacs can generate a (semantic) imenu index for are
   supported.
 * Visual feedback :: When it would otherwise be difficult to see the message in the minibuffer success/failure is
   indicated with pulse.el
 * Ease of use :: Treemacs offers many configuration options, but comes with a set of (what hopefully should be) sane
   defaults. Installation aside there are two obligatory pieces of setup: 1) Choosing convenient keybindings to run
   treemacs and 2) If you use evil: requiring ~treemacs-evil~ to integrate treemacs with evil and enable j/k navigation.
   More on both below. You can also summon a helpful hydra with ~?~ that will remind you of treemacs' many keybindings
   and features.

* Quick Start
If you don't care about reading the full readme here's a list of some bare bones basics to get you started:
 * First of all: press ~?~ to summon the helpful hydra:
   [[file:hydra.png]]
 * If you use evil don't forget to also install ~treemacs-evil~
 * If you use projectile you can install ~treemacs-projectile~ to allow quickly add your projectile projects to
   treemacs.
 * Treemacs doesn't bind any global keys, you need to use whatever fits you best. A full install setup can be found
   [[Installation][below]]. Otherwise just add a keybind for ~treemacs~.
 * For navigation use n/p (j/k when evil), M-n/M-p to move to same-height neighbour u to go to parent, and C-n/C-k to
   move between projects.
 * There's half a dozen different ways to open nodes, all bound under o as prefix. Pick your favourite.
 * TAB and RET are particularly configurable. See ~treemacs-TAB/RET-actions-config~.
 * Projects administration is bound under the ~C-p~ prefix.

* Detailed Feature List
** Projects and Workspaces
If you've previously used a different explorer like neotre or nerdtree - or an earlier version of treemacs for that
matter - you are probably used to a display system wherein you see exactly a single file tree whose exact root you can
arbitrarily change. This system makes it difficult to work on and switch between multiple projects. Treemacs used to
(and still does) remedy that limitation by making every treemacs buffer unique to its frame, but it has now been
redesigned to be able to display multiple file trees - projects - at once.

In treemacs a workspace is simply a (named) collection of projects, while a project consists of 2 things: its location
in the file system and its display name. This is the info that you need to provide when you want to add a new project to
your workspace. In the future it should be possible to switch between various workspaces and use different workspaces
for different frames' buffers, but as of now there exists only the global default workspace.

This design approach has various advantages and disadvantages. It is now no longer possible to "free roam" in the file
system with treemacs, i.e. you can no longer arbitrarily switch the single file tree's root to the directory at point or
the current root's parent. Another restriction is that the same part of the file system may not appear more than once as
part of the workspace. For example it is not possible to add both /Foo and /Foo/Bar as projects, since internally
treemacs heavily relies on every node having a unique natural key in its absolute path. Nonetheless the pros certainly
outweigh the cons, as a multiroot setup allows to work on multiple projects with any combination concern/buffer
separating frameworks, be it persp, eyebrowse, or projectile. It also opens the potential for concurrent display not
only of the file system, but e.g. the currently open buffers.

** Frame Locality
Treemacs buffers have a limited scope they are visible in: the frames they are created in. A treemacs buffer, once
created, lives alongside and inside its frame, and is also destroyed with that frame. Calling ~treemacs~ while inside a
new frame will create a new buffer for it, regardless how many other treemacs buffers already exist. While there can be
multiple unique treemacs buffer they will all still show the same workspace and the same projects.

A treemacs buffer that does not belong to a frame may still be made visible by manually selecting in the buffer list.
This would break various assumptions in treemacs' code base and effectively falls under undefined behaviour - a bad idea
all around.

** Mouse Interface
Treemacs handles left clicks in much the same way as modern graphical applications do: a single click sets the focus, a
double click expands or collapses a directory or tag section node and visits a file/moves to a tag for a file/tag node.

Additionally tag sections can be expanded or collapsed by a single click on the file/tag section icon.

** Follow-mode
~treemacs-follow-mode~ is a global minor mode which allows the treemacs view to always move its focus to the currently
selected file. This is achieved by advising ~select-window~, which is a ubiquitous function, often called multiple times
in a row when emacs is working. This means two things:

1) ~treemacs-follow~ tries to be very specific about when it is run at all.

2) There may be times when something slips through (~which-key~ for example would cause such a problem if treemacs
wasn't made compatible with it by default). If you do see ~treemacs-follow~ behaving in a way it shouldn't open up an
issue. The fix shouldn't be more than a single bit of advice away.

** Tag-follow-mode
~treemacs-tag-follow-mode~ is a global minor mode which extends and effectively replaces ~treemacs-follow-mode~. When
activated it follows not just the current file, but also the current tag. This works alongside treemacs' integration
with imenu, so all file types providing an imenu implementation are compatible.

This mode runs on an idle timer - the exact duration of inactivity (in seconds) before a move is called is determined by
~treemacs-tag-follow-delay~.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window needs to be temporarily selected, which
will reset ~blink-cursor-mode~'s timer if it is enabled. This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appereance of the tag follow action lasting much longer than it really does.

** Git-mode
~treemacs-git-mode~ is a global minor mode which enables treemacs to check for files' and directories' git status
information and highlight them accordingly (see also the ~treemacs-git-...~ faces). The mode is available in 2 variants:
~simple~ and ~extended~:

 * The simple variant starts a git status process and parses its output in elisp. The parsing is kept quick and simple,
   so some info is missed: this version includes git status information only for files, but not directories.
 * The extended variant highlights both files and directories. This greatly increases the complexity and length of the
   parsing process, and is therefore done in an asynchronous python process for the sake of performance. The extended
   variant requires python3 to work.

When called interactively ~treemacs-git-mode~ will ask for the variant to use. In lisp code an appropriate symbol can be
directly passed to the minor mode function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (treemacs-git-mode 'extended)
#+END_SRC

Both versions use an asynchronous git process and are optimized to not do more work than necessary, so their performance
cost should, for the most part, be the constant amount of time it takes to fork a subprocess.

** Filewatch-mode
~treemacs-filewatch-mode~ is a global minor mode which enables treemacs to watch the files it is displaying for changes
and automatically refresh itself when it detects a change in the file system that it decides is relevant.

A change event is relevant for treemacs if a new file has been created or deleted or a file has been changed and
~treemacs-git-mode~ is enabled. Events caused by files that are ignored as per ~treemacs-ignored-file-predicates~ are
likewise counted as not relevant.

The refresh is not called immediately after an event was received, treemacs instead waits ~treemacs-file-event-delay~ ms
to see if any more files have changed to avoid having to refresh multiple times over a short period of time. Treemacs
will not refresh the entire view to make the detected changes visible, but will instead only make updates to the
directories where the change(s) happened. Using this mode is therefore by far not as expensive as a full refresh on
every change and save.

The mode only applies to directories opened *after* this mode has been activated. This means that to enable file
watching in an already existing treemacs buffer it needs to be killed and rebuilt. Turning off this mode is, on the
other hand, instantaneous - it will immediately turn off all existing file watch processes and outstanding refresh
actions.

_Known limitations_:
Staging and committing changes does not produce any file change events of its own, if you use ~treemacs-git-mode~ you
still need to do a manual refresh to see your files' faces go from 'changed' and 'untracked' to 'unchanged' after a
commit.

** Session Persistence
Treemacs' sessions - your workspace and the projects it contains - are saved when Emacs shuts down and restored when
treemacs is first loaded. This persistence process is fully automatic and independant, and should therefore be fully
compatible with ~desktop-save-mode~.

The persisted state is saved under ~user-emacs-directory/.cache/treemacs-persist~. The exact file location
is saved in the variable ~treemacs--persist-file~.

** Terminal Compatibility
When run in a terminal treemacs will fall back to a much simpler rendering system, foregoing its usual png icons and
using simple ~+~ and ~-~ characters instead. The exact characters used are [[Custom Icons][highly customizable]].

** Tag View
Treemacs is able to display not only the file system, but also tags found in individual files. The tags list is sourced
using emacs' builtin imenu functionality, so all file types that emacs can generate an imenu index for are supported.

Imenu caches its result, so to avoid stale tag lists setting ~imenu-auto-rescan~ to t is recommended. Tags generated
with the help of ~semantic-mode~ are likewise supported.

*** ggtags

Treemacs can show the tags produced by ggtags if you switch a buffer's imenu index function to use ggtags:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-local imenu-create-index-function #'ggtags-build-imenu-index)
#+END_SRC

** Additional Packages
Next to treemacs itself you can optionally install:

*** treemacs-evil
Must be installed and loaded if you use evil. The keybindings and the cursor will not be setup properly otherwise. It'll
also enable navigation with j/k instead of n/p.
*** treemacs-projectile
Allows to quickly add your projectile projects to the treemacs workspace by calling ~treemacs-projectile~.
* Installation
Treemacs is included in spacemacs (for now only on the dev branch). If you are using the development version of
spacemacs you can simply add treemacs to ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ to replace the default neotree. Check ~SPC
h SPC treemacs~ for details. Otherwise you will need to add treemacs to ~dotspacemacs-additional-packages~.

Treemacs is also available from MELPA. If you just want to quickly start using it grab the ~use-package~ example below,
and customize it as needed (remove ~treemacs-evil~ if you don't use it, customize the keybinds as needed, the example
code uses keys based on the spacemacs layer).

Either way keep in mind that treemacs has /no default keybinds/ for its globally callable initialization functions.
Each user is supposed to select keybinds for functions like ~treemacs~  and its projectile counterpart based on whatever
they find convenient.

You can find an exhaustive overview of all functions, their keybinds and functions you need to bind yourself [[Keymap][below]].

** Faces
Treemacs defines and uses the following faces:

| treemacs-help-title-face          | font-lock-constant-face      | Face used for the title of the helpful hydra.                                |
| treemacs-help-column-face         | font-lock-keyword-face       | Face used for the column headers of the helpful hydra.                       |

** Evil compatibility
To make treemacs get along with evil-mode you need to install and load ~treemacs-evil~. It does not define any functions
or offer any configuration options, making sure it is loaded is sufficient.

** Custom Icons
The icons treemacs uses can be roughly divided into the following 3 groups (with the first 2 behaving identically). Each
group also makes further adjustments depending on whether treemacs is shown in a GUI or terminal frame. Changes to
icons, as described below, will takes place when a treemacs buffer is killed and rebuilt. Changes to icons can be
reverted by calling ~treemacs-reset-icons~.

*Important*: There is a restriction that all icons must must be exactly 2 characters long. That's including the space
that will separate an icon from the filename.

*** Directory Icons
These are the 2 icons used for expanded or closed directory nodes. They are stored in the variables ~treemacs-icop-open~
and ~treemacs-icon-closed~. Depending on whether the treemacs instance runs in a GUI or TUI they'll assume different
values stored in other variables:

| Variable               | Value in GUI               | Value in TUI                |
|------------------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------|
| ~treemacs-icop-open~   | ~treemacs-icon-open-png~   | ~treemacs-icon-open-text~   |
| ~treemacs-icon-closed~ | ~treemacs-icon-closed-png~ | ~treemacs-icon-closed-text~ |

To change the display of directory nodes you need to overwrite the values of the png/text variables. For example the
code to use unicode icons to display directories in gui mode could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (setq treemacs-icon-open-png   (propertize "⊖ " 'face 'treemacs-directory-face)
          treemacs-icon-closed-png (propertize "⊕ " 'face 'treemacs-directory-face)))
#+END_SRC

*** Tag Icons

Tag icons behave just like directory icons, except there's 3 of them: one for closed tag sections, one for open tag
sections and one for the tags proper:

| Variable                        | Value in GUI                        | Value in TUI                        |
|---------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open~   | ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open-png~   | ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open-txt~   |
| ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed~ | ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-png~ | ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-txt~ |
| ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf~        | ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-png~        | ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-txt~        |

Same as above, to change the display of tag nodes you need to overwrite the values of the png/text variables. For
example the code to use textual icons to display tags in gui mode could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (setq treemacs-icon-tag-node-open-png   (propertize "− " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)
          treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-png (propertize "+ " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)
          treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-png        (propertize "🞄 " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)))
#+END_SRC

*** File Icons

First of all if you have an icon you'd like to make use of in treemacs my preferred solution is very much for you to
open a pull request (adding a new icon is a one-liner in treemacs-visuals.el, see the last part of the [[Contributing]]
section) or an issue to let me know about a good icon I can add.

If that's not possible or if you'd like to use something like ~all-the-icons.el~ (which isn't used in treemacs by
default due to iconic fonts not being monospaced and therefore oftentimes looking uneven) treemacs offers the option to
use your own custom file icons.

File icons are implemented differently than the other icon groups. They too exist as variables, usually named like
~treemacs-icon-html~, but the selection process happens through a hashtable - ~treemacs-icons-hash~ - which maps file
extensions to their icons. Note that treemacs has a very loose definition of what constitutes a file extension - it's
either everything past the last period, or just the file's full name if there is no period. This makes it possible to
match file names like '.gitignore' and 'Makefile'. Extensions are not case-sensitive and will be downcased when their
icons is to be retrieved.

There is also the special case of ~treemacs-icon-fallback~, which is used when a file extension has no specific icon
assigned to it. It takes the value ~treemacs-icon-text~ in a GUI and ~treemacs-icon-fallback-text~ in a TUI.

While it is possible to directly push a mapping to ~treemacs-icons-hash~ treemacs also offers the utility function
~treemacs-define-custom-icon~. It takes as its arguments an icon (a string) and as ~&rest~ a list of file extension to
use the icon for. Already present icons for the given extensions will be overwritten.

Using it would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (defvar treemacs-custom-html-icon (all-the-icons-icon-for-file "name.html"))
    (treemacs-define-custom-icon treemacs-custom-html-icon "html" "htm"))
#+END_SRC

*** Icons according to ~auto-mode-alist~
For some file extensions, like ".cc" or ".hh", it is not immediately obvious which major mode will open these files, and
thus which icon they should be assigned. Treemacs offers the option that automate this decision based on
~auto-mode-alist~. You can use the function ~treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist~ to change the assigned icons for a
list of file extensions based on the major mode the icons are mapped to in ~auto-mode-alist~.

~treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist~ takes 2 arguments: first a list of file extensions, then an alist that decides
which icon should be used for which mapped major mode. For example the code to decide the icons for ".hh" and ".cc"
files with ~auto-mode-alist~ would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist
      '(".cc" ".hh")
      '((c-mode . treemacs-icon-c)
        (c++-mode . treemacs-icon-cpp))))
#+END_SRC

*** GUI vs TUI
It is possible to force treemacs to use the simple TUI icons in GUI mode by setting ~treemacs-no-png-images~ to t.

*** Indent guide
Not really part of the icons, but a useful visual feature nonetheless: An indent guide like effect can be created by
selecting appropriate values for ~treemacs-indentation~ and ~treemacs-indentation-string~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq treemacs-indentation-string (propertize " ⫶ " 'face 'font-lock-comment-face)
        treemacs-indentation 1)
#+END_SRC

* Keymap
** Unbound functions
These functions are not bound to any keys by default. It's left up to users to find the most convenient key binds.

| treemacs-delete-other-windows | Same as ~delete-other-windows~, but will not delete the treemacs window.   |

** Default keymap
By default Treemacs's keymap looks as follows:

| Key     | Action                                      | Description                                                                                                    |

* Compatibility
The correctness of treemacs' display behaviour is, to a large degree, ensured through window properties and reacting to
changes in the window configuration. The packages most likely to cause trouble for treemacs are therefore those that
interfere with Emacs' buffer spawning and window splitting behaviour. Treemacs is included in spacemacs and I am a
spacemacs user, therefore treemacs guarantees first-class support & compatibility for window-managing packages used in
spacemacs, namely [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][persp]], [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][popwin]] and [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][window-purpose]], as well as [[https://github.com/wasamasa/shackle][shackle]]. For everything else there may be
issues and, depending on the complexity of the problem, I may decide it is not worth fixing.

Aside from this there are the following known incompatibilities:

 * Any package invoking ~font-lock-ensure~ in the treemacs buffer. This will reset the faces of treemacs' buttons (once)
   and is a known [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=28599][emacs bug]].
 * A possible cause of this issue using an old version of swiper.
 * Rainbow mode activated in treemacs will likewise produce this behaviour. Make sure not to include rainbow-mode as
   part of ~special-mode-hook~, since this is the mode ~treemacs-mode~ is derived from.

* FAQ
 * Why am I seeing no file icons and only +/- for directories?

   Treemacs will permanently fall back on its simple TUI icons if it detects that the emacs instance it is run in cannot
   create images. You can test this by evaluating ~(create-image "" 'png)~. If this code returns an error like "Invalid
   image type ´png´" your emacs does not support images.

 * How do I get treemacs to stop telling me when it's been refreshed, especially with filewatch-mode?

   See ~treemacs-silent-refresh~ and ~treemacs-silent-filewatch~.

 * Why is treemacs warning me about not being able to find some background colors and falling back to something else?

   Treemacs needs those colors to make sure that background colors of its icons correctly align with hl-line-mode. Png
   images' backgrounds are not highlighted by hl-line-mode by default, treemacs is manually correcting this every time
   hl-line's overlay is moved. To make that correction work it needs to know two colors: the current theme's ~default~
   background, and its ~hl-line~ background color. If treemacs cannot find hl-lines's background color it falls back to
   the default background color. If it cannot even find the default background it will fall back to #2d2d31. The
   warnings serve to inform you of that fallback.

   If your theme does not define a required color you can set it yourself before treemacs loads like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (set-face-attribute 'hl-line nil :background "#333333")
   #+END_SRC

   If you just want to disable the warnings you can do so by defining the varialbe ~treemacs-no-load-time-warnings~. Its
   exact value is irrelevant, all that matters is that it exists at all. Since the warnings are issues when treemacs is
   first being loaded the variable must be defined *before* treemacs is initialized. This is best achieved by adding the
   line ~(defvar treemacs-no-load-time-warnings t)~ to treemacs' use-package ~:init~ block.

* Contributing
Contributions are very much welcome, but should fit the general scope and style of treemacs. The following is a list of
guidelines that should be met (excepions confirm the rule):

 - There should be one commit per feature.
 - Code must be in the right place (what with the codebase being split in many small files). If there is no right place
   it probably goes into treemacs-impl.el which is where all the general implementation details go.
 - New features must be documented in the readme (for example mentioning new config options in the [[Variables][Config Table]]).
 - There must not be any compiler warnings.
 - The test suite must pass.

Treemacs uses cask to setup a local testing environment and a makefile that simplifies compiling and testing the
codebase. First run ~cask install~ to locally pull treemacs' dependencies. Then you can use the following 3 makefile
targets:

 - make compile :: Compiles the code base (and treats compiler warnings as errors).
 - make clean :: Removes the generated .elc files.
 - make test :: Runs the testsuite, once in a graphical environment and once in the terminal.

Finally if you want to just add an icon you can take [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/commit/94df3e36af865dab2c76b549b1a61f418e3bf5be][this commit]] as an example.
