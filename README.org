* Quick Feature Overview

Treemacs is a file and project explorer in the same vein as NeoTree or vim's NerdTree. It shows the file system outline in a
simple tree layout allowing quick navigation and exploration, while also possessing *basic* file management utilities.
Specifically a quick feature overview looks as follows:

 * Easy navigation - quickly change the root directory or use shortcuts to jump to parent or neighbouring nodes.
 * Versatile file access - decide exactly how and where a file will be opened, including using ~ace-window~ to choose
   a window or launching an external application.
 * Treemacs respects frames - every frame will receive its own treemacs buffer that will live and die with that frame.
 * Optionally always follow along and keep in focus the currently selected file or even the tag at point using
   ~treemacs-follow-mode~ and ~treemacs-tag-follow-mode~ respectively.
 * Optional git integration - treemacs will use different faces for files and directories based on their git status.
   The git process runs asynchronously and so will rarely cause any perceptible delay.
 * [[https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum][Winum]] compatibility - treemacs will not interfere with winum's numbering layout, your first window will always remain
   your first window.
 * [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] integration via the ~treemacs-projectile~ package to quickly open treemacs at any known project's root directory.
 * Simple mouse interface (for left clicks) in line with graphical applications
 * Dashing good looks - treemacs uses genuine png images in HD 22x22 resolution for its icons (quantity is, of course,
   another matter). When run in a terminal a very simple fallback is used.
 * Session persistence with ~desktop-save-mode~
 * Treemacs is able to display files' tags. All file types that emacs can generate a (semantic) imenu
   index for are supported.
 * Visual feedback on success/failure with pulse.el
 * Ease of use - treemacs offers many configuration options, but comes with a set of (what hopefully should be) sane
   defaults. Installation aside there are two obligatory pieces of setup: 1) Choosing convenient keybindings to run
   treemacs and 2) If you use evil: requiring ~treemacs-evil~ to integrate treemacs with evil and enable j/k navigation.
   More on both below.

* Quick Start
If you don't care about reading the full readme here's a list of some bare bones basics to get you started:
 * First of all: press ~?~ to summon the helpful hydra:
   [[file:hydra.png]]
 * If you use evil don't forget to also install ~treemacs-evil~
 * If you use projectile you can install ~treemacs-projectile~ to allow treemacs to interact with projects.
 * Treemacs doesn't bind any global keys, you need to use whatever fits you best. A full install setup for
   spacemacs can be found [[#installation][below]]. Otherwise just bind ~treemacs~ and ~treemacs-toggle~.
 * For navigation use n/p (j/k when evil), M-n/M-p to move to same-height neighbour u to go to parent, h to
   move up a dir, l to move root to selected dir
 * There's half a dozen different ways to open nodes, all bound under o as prefix. Pick your favourite.
 * TAB and RET are particularly configurable. See ~treemacs-TAB/RET-actions-config~.

* Detailed Feature List
** Frame Locality
Treemacs buffers have a limited scope they are visible in: the frames they are created in. A treemacs buffer, once created,
lives alongside and inside its frame, and is also destroyed with that frame. Calling a function like ~treemacs-toggle~ while
inside a new frame will create a new buffer for it, reguardless how many other treemacs buffers already exist.

This allows to use treemacs to work on multiple projects inside the same emacs session.

A treemacs buffer that does not belong to a frame may still be made visible by manually selecting in in the buffer list. This
would break various assumptions in treemacs' code base and effectively falls under undefined behaviour - a bad idea all around.
** Mouse Interface
Treemacs handles left clicks in much the same way as modern graphical applications do: a single click sets the focus, a
double click expands or collapses a directory or tag section node and visits a file/moves to a tag for a file or tag node.

Additionally tags can be expanded or collapsed by a single click on the file/tag section icon.

** Follow-mode
~treemacs-follow-mode~ is a minor mode which allows the treemacs view to always move its focus to the
currently selected file. This is achieved by advising ~select-window~, which is a ubiquitous function, often called
multiple times in a row when emacs is working. This means two things:

1) ~treemacs-follow~ tries to be very specific about when it is run at all.

2) There may be times when something slips through (~which-key~ for example would cause such a problem if treemacs
wasn't made compatible with it by default). If you do see ~treemacs-follow~ behaving in a way it shouldn't open up
an issue. The fix shouldn't be more than a single bit of advice away.

** Tag-follow-mode
~treemacs-tag-follow-mode~ is a minor mode which extends and effectively replaces ~treemacs-follow-mode~. When activated
it follows not just the current file, but also the current tag. This works alongside treemacs' with imenu, so all file
types providing an imenu implementation are compatible.

This mode runs on an idle timer - the exact duration of inactivity (in seconds) is determined by ~treemacs-tag-follow-delay~.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window needs to be temporarily selected, which will
reset ~blink-cursor-mode~'s timer if it is enabled. This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appereance of the tag follow action lasting much longer than it really does.

** Git-mode
~treemacs-git-mode~ is a minor mode which enables treemacs to check for files' and directories' git status information
and highlight them accordingly (see also the ~treemacs-git-...~ faces). The mode is available in 2 variants: ~simple~ and
~extended~:

 * The simple variant starts a git status process and parses its output in elisp. The parsing is kept quick and simple,
   so some info is missed: this version includes git status information only for files, but not directories.
 * The extended variant highlights both files and directories. This greatly increases the complexity and length of the
   parsing process, and is therefore done in a python process for the sake of performance. The extended variant will thus
   not work without python3.

When called interactively ~treemacs-git-mode~ will ask for the variant to use. In lisp code an appropriate symbol can be
directly passed to the minor mode function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (treemacs-git-mode 'extended)
#+END_SRC

Both variants use an asynchronous process and are optimized to not do morr work than necessary, so their performance cost
should, for the most part, be the constant amount of time it takes to fork a subprocess.

** Filewatch-mode
~treemacs-filewatch-mode~ is a minor mode which enables treemacs to watch the files it is displaying for changes
and automatically refresh itself by means of ~treemacs-refresh~ when it detects a change that it decides is relevant.

A file event is relevant for treemacs if a new file has been created or deleted or a file has been changed and
~treemacs-git-mode~ is enabled. Events caused by files that are ignored as per ~treemacs-ignored-file-predicates~
are likewise counted as not relevant.

The refresh is not called immediately after an event was received, treemacs instead waits ~treemacs-file-event-delay~
ms to see if any more files have changed to avoid having to refresh multiple times over a short period of time. If
the treemacs buffer exists, but is not visible, a refresh will be run the next time it is shown.

The change only applies to directories opened *after* this mode has been activated. This means that to enable file
watching in an already existing treemacs buffer it needs to be torn down and rebuilt by calling ~treemacs~ or
~treemacs-projectile~.

Turning off this mode is, on the other hand, instantaneous - it will immediately turn off all existing file watch
processes and outstanding refresh actions.

_Known limitations_:
Staging and committing changes does not produce any file change events of its own, if you use ~treemacs-git-mode~
you still need to do a manual refresh to see your files' faces go from 'changed' and 'untracked' to 'unchanged' after a commit.

** Session Persistence
To persist treemacs state beyond emacs' shutdown treemacs offers integration with the builtin
~desktop-save-mode~. This integration shoud work out of the box and require zero setup and configuration
(aside from the option to turn it off with ~treemacs-never-persist~).

The persisted state is saved under ~user-emacs-directory/.cache/treemacs-persist~. The exact file location
is saved in the variable ~treemacs--persist-file~.

Persistence by means other than ~desktop-save-mode~ (like ~persp-mode~) is not supported since treemacs' frame-bound
nature makes integration very difficult if not outright impossible.

** Terminal Compatibility
When run in a terminal treemacs will fall back to a much simpler rendering system, foregoing its usual png icons and using
simple ~+~ and ~-~ characters instead. Changes to the current rendering system are detected automatically - within some
limits. The check for the change happens with treemacs' functions which build or show/hide the treemacs buffer, namely
~treemacs(-projectile)~. ~treemacs(-projectile)-toggle~ and ~treemacs-refresh~.

** Tag View
Treemacs is able to display not only the file system, but also tags found in individual files. The tags list is sourced
using emacs' builtin imenu functionality, so all file types that emacs can generate an imenu index for are supported.
Imenu caches its result, so to avoid stale tag lists setting ~imenu-auto-rescan~ to t is recommended. Tags generated
with the help of ~semantic-mode~ are likewise supported.

*** ggtags

Treemacs can show the tags produced by ggtags if you switch a buffer's imenu index function to use ggtags:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-local imenu-create-index-function #'ggtags-build-imenu-index)
#+END_SRC

** Additional Packages
Next to treemacs itself you can optionally install:

*** treemacs-evil
Must be installed and loaded if you use evil. The keybindings and the cursor will not be setup
properly otherwise. It'll also enable navigation  navigation with j/k instead of n/p.

*** treemacs-projectile
Introduces projectile-centric counterparts for treemacs-launching commands, namely ~treemacs-projectile~
and ~treemacs-projectile-toggle~. Also adds ~treemacs-create-header-projectile~ to be used as a value
for ~treemacs-header-function~.

* Installation

Treemacs is included in spacemacs. If you are using the development version of spacemacs you can simply add treemacs
to ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ to replace the default neotree. Check ~SPC h SPC treemacs~ for details.

Treemacs is also available from MELPA. If you just want to quickly start using it grab the ~use-package~ example
below, and customize it as needed (remove ~treemacs-evil~ if you don't use it, customize the keybinds as needed, the
example code uses keys based on the spacemacs layer).

Either way keep in mind that treemacs has /no default keybinds/ for its globally callable initialization functions.
Each user is supposed to select keybinds for functions like ~treemacs~, ~treemacs-toggle~ and their projectile
counterparts based on whatever they find convenient.

You can find an exhaustive overview of all functions, their keybinds and functions you need to bind yourself [[#keymap][below]].

Ignored files will *never* be shown in the treemacs buffer (unlike dotfiles) whose presence is controlled by ~treemacs-show-hidden-files~). Each predicate is a function that takes a file's name and absolute path as its arguments and returns t if the file should be ignored and nil otherwise. A file whose name returns t for *any* function in this list counts as ignored. By default this list contains ~treemacs--std-ignore-file-predicate~ which filters out '.', '..', Emacs' lock files as well as flycheck's temp files, and therefore should not be directly overwritten, but added to and removed from instead. |

| treemacs-goto-tag-strategy          | refetch-index                               | Indicates how to move to a tag when its buffer is dead. The tags in the treemacs view store their position as markers pointing to a buffer. If that buffer is killed, or has never really been open, as treemacs kills buffer after fetching their tags if they did no exist before, the stored positions become stale, and treemacs needs to use a different method to move to that tag. This variable sets that method. Its possible values are: ~refetch-index~: Call up the file's imenu index again and use its information to jump. ~call-xref~: Call ~xref-find-definitions~ to find the tag. ~issue-warning~: Just issue a warning that the tag's position pointer is invalid.                  |

A directory is collapsible when its content consists of nothing but another directory. The value determines how many directories can be collapsed at once, both as a performance cap and to prevent too long directory names in the treemacs view. To minimize this option's impact on display performance the search for directories to collapse is done asynchronously in a python script and will thus only work when python installed. The script should work both on python2 and 3.                                                                                                                                            |

** Faces

Treemacs defines and uses the following faces:
| Face                              | Inherits from                                   | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| treemacs-directory-face           | font-lock-function-name-face                    | Face used for directories.                                                   |
| treemacs-directory-collapsed-face | treemacs-directory-face                         | Face used for collapsed part of directories.                                 |
| treemacs-file-face                | default                                         | Face used for files.                                                         |
| treemacs-header-face              | font-lock-constant-face (underlined & size 1.4) | Face used for the treemacs header.                                           |
| treemacs-term-node-face           | font-lock-string-face                           | Face for directory node symbols used by treemacs when it runs in a terminal. |
| treemacs-git-*-face               | various font lock faces                         | Faces used by treemacs for various git states.                               |
| treemacs-on-success-pulse-face    | :fg #11111 :bg #669966                          | Pulse face used when pulsing on a successful action.                         |
| treemacs-on-failure-puse-face     | :fg #111111 :bg ab3737                          | Pulse face used when pulsing on a failed action.                             |

** Evil compatibility
To make treemacs get along with evil-mode you need to install and load ~treemacs-evil~. It does not define any functions
or offer any configuration options, making sure it is loaded is sufficient.

** Custom header function

The function which creates the header in treemacs is easily replaced (see the entry for ~treemacs-header-function~ in the
section about [[#variables][configuration variables]] for details). To use your own custom header you just need to define a function that
formats the header as you wish and then tell treemacs to use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun treemacs-header-with-brackets (current-root)
    (format "<%s>" (file-name-nondirectory current-root)))
  (setq treemacs-header-function #'treemacs-header-with-brackets)
#+END_SRC

** Custom Icons

The icons treemacs uses can be roughly divided into 3 groups (with the first 2 behaving identically). Each group
also makes further adjustments depending on whether treemacs is shown in a GUI or terminal frame.

Changes to icons, as described below, will takes place when a treemacs buffer is reinitialized. This means you need to
call a function like ~treemacs~ or ~treemacs-projectile~.

The changes to icons can be reverted by calling ~treemacs-reset-icons~.

*Important*: There is a restriction that all icons must must be exactly 2 characters long. That's including the space
that will separate an icon from filename.

*** Directory Icons

These are the 2 icons used for expanded or closed directory nodes. They are stored in the variables ~treemacs-icop-open~
and ~treemacs-icon-closed~. Depending on whether the treemacs instance runs in a gui or tui they'll assume different values
stored in other variables:

| Variable               | Value in GUI               | Value in TUI                |
|------------------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------|
| ~treemacs-icop-open~   | ~treemacs-icon-open-png~   | ~treemacs-icon-open-text~   |
| ~treemacs-icon-closed~ | ~treemacs-icon-closed-png~ | ~treemacs-icon-closed-text~ |

To change the display of directory nodes you need to overwrite the values of the png/text variables. For example the code
to use unicode icons to display directories in gui mode could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (setq treemacs-icon-open-png   (propertize "⊖ " 'face 'treemacs-directory-face)
          treemacs-icon-closed-png (propertize "⊕ " 'face 'treemacs-directory-face)))
#+END_SRC

*** Tag Icons

Tag icons behave just like directory icons, except there's 3 of them: one for closed tag sections, one for open tag sections
and one for the tags proper:

| Variable                        | Value in GUI                        | Value in TUI                        |
|---------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open~   | ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open-png~   | ~treemacs-icop-tag-node-open-txt~   |
| ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed~ | ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-png~ | ~treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-txt~ |
| ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf~        | ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-png~        | ~treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-txt~        |

Same as above, to change the display of tag nodes you need to overwrite the values of the png/text variables. For example
the code to use unicode icons to display tags in gui mode could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (setq treemacs-icon-tag-node-open-png   (propertize "− " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)
          treemacs-icon-tag-node-closed-png (propertize "+ " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)
          treemacs-icon-tag-leaf-png        (propertize "🞄 " 'face 'font-lock-keyword-face)))
#+END_SRC

*** File Icons

First of all if you have an icon you'd like to make use of in treemacs my preferred solution is very much
for you to open a pull request (adding a new icon is a one-liner in treemacs-visuals.el) or an issue
to let me know about a good icon I can add.

If that's not possible or if you'd like to use something like ~all-the-icons.el~ (which isn't used in treemacs
by default due to iconic fonts not being monospaced and so would look bad) treemacs offers the option to use your own
custom file icons.

File icons are implemented differently than the other icon groups. They too exist as variables, usually named like
~treemacs-icon-html~, but the selection process happens through a hashtable - ~treemacs-icons-hash~ - which maps file
extensions to their icons. Note that treemacs has a very loose definition of what constitutes a file extension - it's
either everything past the last period, or just the file's full name if there is no period. This makes it possible to
match file names like '.gitignore' and 'Makefile'. Extensions are not case-sensitive and will be downcased.

There is also the special case of ~treemacs-icon-fallback~, which is used when a file extension has no specific icon
assigned to it. It takes the value ~treemacs-icon-text~ in a GUI and ~treemacs-icon-fallback-text~ in a TUI.

While it is possible to directly push a mapping to ~treemacs-icons-hash~ treemacs also offers the utility function
~treemacs-define-custom-icon~. It takes as its arguments an icon (a string) and as ~&rest~ a list of file extension to
use the icon for. Already present icons for the given extensions will be overwritten.

Using it would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (defvar treemacs-custom-html-icon (all-the-icons-icon-for-file "name.html"))
    (treemacs-define-custom-icon treemacs-custom-html-icon "html" "htm"))
#+END_SRC

*** Icons according to ~auto-mode-alist~

For some file extensions, like ".cc" or ".hh", it is not immediately obvious which major mode will open these files, and
thus which icon they should be assigned. Treemacs offers the option that automate this decision based on ~auto-mode-alist~.
You can use the function ~treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist~ to change the assigned icons for a list of file extensions
based on the major mode the icons are mapped to in ~auto-mode-alist~.

~treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist~ takes 2 arguments: first a list of file extensions, then an alist that decides
which icon should be used for which mapped major mode. For example the code to decide the icons for ".hh" and ".cc" files
with ~auto-mode-alist~ would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "treemacs"
    (treemacs-map-icons-with-auto-mode-alist
      '(".cc" ".hh")
      '((c-mode . treemacs-icon-c)
        (c++-mode . treemacs-icon-cpp))))
#+END_SRC

*** GUI vs TUI
It is possible to force treemacs to use the simple TUI icons in GUI mode by setting ~treemacs-no-png-images~ to t.

*** Indent guide
Not really part of the icons, but a useful visual feature nonetheless:
An indent guide like effect can be created by selecting appropriate values for ~treemacs-indentation~ and
~treemacs-indentation-string~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq treemacs-indentation-string (propertize " ⫶ " 'face 'font-lock-comment-face)
        treemacs-indentation 1)
#+END_SRC

* Keymap
** Unbound functions
These functions are not bound to any keys by default. It's left up to users to find the most convenient key binds.
Additionally ~treemacs-refresh~, ~treemacs-select-window~ and ~treemacs-find-file~ may also be called from outside
the treemacs window and might therefore need their own global binding.

** Default keymap
By default Treemacs's keymap looks as follows:

| Key     | Action                                      | Description                                                                                                                             |

* Compatibility
The correctness of treemacs' display behaviour is, to a large degree, ensured through window properties and reacting
to changes in the window configuration. The packages most likely to cause trouble for treemacs are therefore those that
interfere with Emacs' buffer spawning and window splitting behaviour. Treemacs is included in spacemacs and I am a spacemacs
user, therefore treemacs guarantees first-class support & compatibility for window-managing packages used in spacemacs, namely
[[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][persp]], [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][eyebrowse]], [[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][popwin]] and [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][window-purpose]], as well as [[https://github.com/wasamasa/shackle][shackle]]. For everything else there may be issues and, depending on the
complexity of the problem, I may decide it is not worth fixing.

Aside from this there are the following known incompatibilities:

 * Any package invoking ~font-lock-ensure~ in the treemacs buffer. This will reset the faces of treemacs' buttons (once)
   and is a known [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=28599][emacs bug]].
 * The only known example of this is an older version of swiper.
 * Rainbow mode activated in treemacs will likewise cause this behaviour. Make sure not to include rainbow-mode as part
   of ~special-mode-hook~, since this is the mode ~treemacs-mode~ is derived from.

* FAQ
 * Why am I seeing no file icons and only +/- for directories?

   Treemacs will permanently fall back on its simple TUI icons if it detects that the emacs instance it is run in cannot
   create images. You can test this by evaluating ~(create-image "" 'png)~. If this code returns an error like
   "Invalid image type ´png´" your emacs does not support images.

 * How do I get treemacs to stop telling me when it's been refreshed, especially with filewatch-mode?

   See ~treemacs-silent-refresh~ and ~treemacs-silent-filewatch~.

 * Why is treemacs warning me about not being able to find some background colors and falling back to something else?

   Treemacs needs those colors to make sure that background colors of its icons correctly align with hl-line-mode. Png images'
   backgrounds are not highlighted by hl-line-mode by default, treemacs manually corrects this. To that end it needs two colors:
   the current theme's ~default~ background, and its ~hl-line~ background color. If treemacs cannot find hl-lines's background
   color it falls back to the default background color. If it cannot even find the default background it will fall back to
   #2d2d31. The warnings serve to inform you of that fallback.

   If your theme does not define a required color you can set it yourself before treemacs loads like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (set-face-attribute 'hl-line nil :background "#333333")
   #+END_SRC

   If you just want to disable the warnings you can do so by defining the varialbe ~treemacs-no-load-time-warnings~. Its exact
   value is irrelevant, all that matters is that it exists at all. Since the warnings are issues when treemacs is first being
   loaded the variable must be defined *before* treemacs is initialized. This is best achieved by adding the line
   ~(defvar treemacs-no-load-time-warnings t)~ to treemacs use-package's ~:init~ block.
