  ;; saved at all, just a single treemacs-mode buffer called `treemacs--desktop-helper-name',
  ;; which only exists so desktop mode will load treemacs.
  ;; If desktop mode tries to restore that buffer during the eager phase `treemacs--restore'
  ;; is a noop, and will run again, properly, as part of `desktop-after-read-hook', when
  ;; frame parameters have been restored.
  ;; If this buffer is restored lazily instead frame params will have been restored,
  ;; so `treemacs--restore' will work immediately.
