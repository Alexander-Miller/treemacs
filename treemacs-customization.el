Note about performance:
Treemacs does its best to optimize its performance critical path, it does so
by doing as little work as possible and producing as little garbage as possible.
Deciding on the order in which its nodes are inserted is a part of this path. As
such certain tradeoffs need to be accounted far.

In plaintext: some sort settings are much slower than others. Alphabetic sorting
\(the default) is fastest and causes no additional overhead (even when
foregoing sorting altogether).

Modification time sorting takes the middle, being ca. 4x slower than alphabetic.
Sorting by size is slowest, being ca. 5-6x slower than alphabetic. It also
produces the most garbage, making it more like for you to run into a garbage
collection pause.

Lest these numbers scare you off keep in mind that they will likely have little
to no effect on your usage of treemacs until you begin frequently refreshing
treemacs views containing hundreds or even thousands of nodes."

never really been open, as treemacs kills buffer after fetching their tags if
they did no exist before, the stored positions become stale, and treemacs needs
to use a different method to move to that tag. This variale sets that method.

Its possible values are:
