;; An explanation for the what and why of the icon highlighting code below:
;; Using png images in treemacs has one annoying visual flaw: they overwrite the overlay
;; used by hl-line, such that the line marked by hl-line will always show a 22x22 pixel
;; gap wherever treemacs places an icon, regardess of transparency.
;; Using xpm instead of png images is one way to work around this, but it degrades icon
;; quality to an unacceptable degree. Another way is to directly change images' :background
;; property. The backgrounds colors are derived from the current theme with `treemacs--setup-icon-highlight'
;; and saved in `treemacs--selected-icon-background' and `treemacs--not-selected-icon-background'.
;; Every icon string stores two images with the proper :background values in its properties
;; 'img-selected and 'img-unselected. The 'display property of the icon in the current line
;; is then highlighted, and the previously highlighted icon unhighlighted, by advising
;; `hl-line-highlight'. The last displayed icon is saved as a button marker in `treemacs--last-highlight'.
;; Since it is a marker in the treemacs buffer it is important for it to be reset whenever it might
;; become invalid.
