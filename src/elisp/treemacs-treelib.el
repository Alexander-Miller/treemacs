  "Base building block for extension node setup.
Not meant for direct use.  Instead one of the following macros should be
employed:

 - `treemacs-define-leaf-node-type'
 - `treemacs-define-expandable-node-type'
 - `treemacs-define-entry-node-type'
 - `treemacs-define-variadic-entry-node-type'

NAME of this node type is a symbol.  After an extension is defined the NAME
symbol can be passed to a function like `treemacs-initialize' or
`treemacs-enable-top-level-extension' to make start using it.

CHILDREN is a form to query a list of items to be rendered as children when a
node is expanded.  The node being expanded is available as a variable under the
name `btn'.  It is a `button' in the sense of the built-in button.el library
\(really just a marker to a buffer position), so its text-properties can be
extracted via `(treemacs-button-get node :property)' (see also MORE-PROPERTIES).
In addition the item (as produced by the form passed here) that was used to
create the node will also be available under the name `item'.

KEY, LABEL, OPEN-ICON, CLOSE-ICON and MORE-PROPERTIES all act on one of the
items produced by CHILDREN.  The node and the item that produced it will be
bound under the names `btn' and `item' respectively.

KEY is a form to generate a semi-unique key for a given node for one of the
items produced by CHILDREN.  Semi-unique means that nodes' keys don't all have
to be unique on their own, it is only necessary that a node's path - the list of
all node keys starting from the top level root leading to a specific node - must
be un-ambiguous.

LABEL is a form to query a node's text label (the text after the icon) for one
of the items produced by CHILDREN.  The return value should be a string.

OPEN-ICON and CLOSED-ICON are forms to determine the icons used for the node's
open and closed states.  The return value should be a string.

MORE-PROPERTIES is a form to produce a plist that will be saved as additional
text-properties in a given node.  These properties can later be accessed when
querying the node's CHILDREN (see above).

CHILD-TYPE is, unlike all the other arguments, not a form, but a quoted symbol.
It must refer to the NAME argument of a another (or the same) extension type and
determines the behaviours (LABEL etc.) used to create the children of the node
type being defined here.

RET-ACTION is the function that is called when RET is pressed on a node of this
be able to handle both a closed and open state.  If no explicit RET-ACTION type.
The function is called with a single argument - the prefix arg - and must
argument is given RET will do the same as TAB.

NO-TAB indicates that pressing TAB on this node type should do nothing.  It will
be set by `treemacs-define-leaf-node'.

VARIADIC is only relevant for entry-point nodes and indicates that the extension
will produces multiple nodes when first rendered.

ASYNC will enable an asynchronous, callback-based fetching of CHILDREN.  When it
is non-nil the function passed to children will be called with the 3rd argument
`callback'.  It should be invoked via `funcall' with the items that were
produced asynchronously.

If the asynchronous execution fails the `callback' should be called with a list
in the form \(`:async-error' error-message\).  Treemacs will take care of
cleanup and logging the error.

ENTRY-POINT indicates that the node type defined here is an entry-point for an
extension, it will be used as a type-check when enabling an extension with e.g.
`treemacs-enable-top-level-extension'."
