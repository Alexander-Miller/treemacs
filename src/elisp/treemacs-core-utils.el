  "Find position of node identified by PATH under PROJECT in the current buffer.
Inspite the signature this function effectively supports two different calling
conventions.

The first one is for movement towards a node that identifies a file. In this
case the signature is applied as is, and this function diverges simply into
`treemacs-goto-file-node'. PATH is a filepath string while PROJECT is fully
optional, as treemacs is able to determine which project, if any, a given file
belongs to. Providing the project is therefore only a matter of efficiency and
convenience. If PROJECT is not given it will be found with
`treemacs--find-project-for-path'. No attempt is made to verify that PATH falls
under a project in the workspace. It is assumed that this check has already been
made.

The second calling convention deals with custom nodes defined by an extension
for treemacs. In this case the PATH is made up of all the node keys that lead to
the node to be moved to.

For a directory extension, created with `treemacs-define-directory-extension',
that means that the path's first element must be the filepath of its parent. For
a project extension, created with `treemacs-define-project-extension', the
first element of the path must instead be the keyword `:custom', followed by the
node's unique path. The second argument is therefore ignored in this case.

Either way this fuction will return a marker to the moved to position if it was
successful.
