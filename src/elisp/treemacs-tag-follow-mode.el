;;; Commentary:
;; Minor mode to follow the tag at point in the treemacs view on an idle timer
;; Finding the current tag is a fairly involved process:
;; * Grab current buffer's imenu output
;; * Flatten the list to create full tag paths
;; * Sort according to tag position
;; * Beware of edge cases: org-mode headlines are containers, but also hold a position, hidden as a text property and
;;   semantic-mode parsed buffers use overlays instead of markers
;; * Find the last tag whose position begins before point
;; * Jump to that tag path
;; * No jump when there's no buffer file, or no imenu, or buffer file is not seen in treemacs etc.

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation. When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time. The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a rescan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified). This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset `blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled. This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appereance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does."
