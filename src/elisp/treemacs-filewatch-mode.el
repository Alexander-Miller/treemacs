;;; File event watch and reaction implementation.
;;; Open directories are put under watch and file changes event collected even if filewatch-mode
;;; is disabled. This allows to remove deleted files from all the caches they are in. Activating
;;; filewatch-mode will therefore only enable automatic refresh of treemacs buffers.

  "Keeps track of dirs under filewatch due to being collapsed into one.

Collapsed directories require special handling since all directories of a series
need to be put under watch so as to be notified when the collapsed structure
needs to change, but removing the file watch is not straightforward:

Assume a series of directories are collapsed into one as '/c1/c2/c3/c4' and a
new file is created in '/c1/c2'. A refresh is started and only '/c1/c2' is
collapsed now, c3 and c4 are no longer part of the treemacs view and must be
removed from the filewatch list. However the event that triggered the refresh
was one of a file being created, so it is not possible to know that c3 and c4
need to stop being watched unless one also knows that they and c2 are under file
watch because they have been collapsed.

This is why this hash is used to keep track of collapsed directories under file
watch.")

Activating this mode enables treemacs to watch the files it is displaying (and

change that it decides is relevant.

A file change event is relevant for treemacs if a new file has been created or
deleted or a file has been changed and `treemacs-git-mode' is enabled. Events
caused by files that are ignored as per `treemacs-ignored-file-predicates' are
counted as not relevant.

The refresh is not called immediately after an event was received, treemacs
instead waits `treemacs-file-event-delay' ms to see if any more files have
changed to avoid having to refresh multiple times over a short period of time.

The watch mechanism only applies to directories opened *after* this mode has
been activated. This means that to enable file watching in an already existing
treemacs buffer it needs to be torn down and rebuilt by calling `treemacs' or
`treemacs-projectile'.

Turning off this mode is, on the other hand, instantaneous - it will immediately
turn off all existing file watch processes and outstanding refresh actions."
