Finding the right FONT is a matter of trial and error, you can quickly try
different fonts using `set-frame-font'.

The workaround will overwrite the values for `treemacs-indentation' and
`treemacs-indentation-string', using your own values for them is no longer
possible.

Can only work if the `treemacs-all-the-icons' module has not been loaded yet."
