  "Add of one `projectile-known-projects' to the treemacs workspace."
  (interactive)
  (if (and (bound-and-true-p projectile-known-projects)

;;;###autoload

* If the treemacs window is visible hide it.
* If a treemacs buffer exists, but is not visible show it.

* If the workspace is empty additionally ask for the root path of the first
