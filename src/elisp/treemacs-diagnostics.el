(defun treemacs-apply-diagnostics (provider)
  "Display diagnostics based on the given arguments PROVIDER.
PROVIDER should be a `thunk' (see thunk.el) that, when evaluated, returns a flat
list of consecutive path and face items.

File paths should use treemacs' canonical format - they should be absolute,
expanded and *not* have a trailing slash.

The diagnostic faces could be any face symbols or raw face literals.  Treemacs
features several pre-made faces named `treemacs-diagnostic-*-face'.

This method is debounced, it will never run more often than once every 3
seconds.  In addition the use of a lazy thunk ensures that potentially expensive
transformations happen only once and only when required.  Performance is thus
not expected to be a major issue.

A basic example use would look like this:

\(treemacs-apply-diagnostics
    (thunk-delay \\='(\"/path/to/file/x\" \\='treemacs-diagnostic-warning-face
                      \"/path/to/file/y\" \\='treemacs-diagnostic-error-face
                      \"/path/to/file/z\" \\='((:underline \"green\")))))"
  (treemacs-debounce treemacs--diagnostic-timer treemacs--apply-diagnostics-delay
    (treemacs-run-in-every-buffer
     (save-excursion
       (-each (overlays-in (point-min) (point-max)) #'delete-overlay)
       (-let [diagnostics (thunk-force provider)]
         (while diagnostics
           (let ((path  (pop diagnostics))
                 (state (pop diagnostics)))
             (when  (treemacs-is-path-visible? path)
               (-let [btn (treemacs-find-file-node path)]
                 (-doto (make-overlay (treemacs-button-start btn) (treemacs-button-end btn))
                   (overlay-put 'face state))))))))
     (hl-line-highlight))))
