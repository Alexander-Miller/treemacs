 * a custom function

In the latter case it must be a function that can be passed to `sort' to sort
absolute filepaths.  For an example see `treemacs--sort-alphabetic-asc'

Note about performance:
Treemacs does its best to optimise its performance critical path, it does so
by doing as little work as possible and producing as little garbage as possible.
Deciding on the order in which its nodes are inserted is a part of this path.
As such certain trade-offs need to be accounted far.

In plaintext: some sort settings are much slower than others.  Alphabetic
sorting \(the default) is fastest and causes no additional overhead (even when
compared against foregoing sorting altogether).

Modification time sorting takes the middle, being ca.  4x slower than alphabetic.
Sorting by size is slowest, being ca.  5-6x slower than alphabetic.  It also
produces the most garbage, making it more like for you to run into a garbage
collection pause.

Lest these numbers scare you off keep in mind that they will likely have little
to no effect on your usage of treemacs until you begin frequently refreshing
treemacs views containing hundreds or even thousands of nodes."

file which returns t for *any* function in this list counts as ignored.

By default this list contains `treemacs--std-ignore-file-predicate' which
filters out '.', '..', Emacs' lock files as well temp files created by flycheck,
and therefore should not be directly overwritten, but added to and removed from

The difference between this and `treemacs-ignored-file-predicates' is that the
functions in this list will be called on files just before they would be
rendered, when the files' git status information is now available.  This for
example allows to make files ignored by git invisible.
The functions in this list are therefore expected to have a different signature:
They must take two arguments - a file's absolute path and a hash table that maps
files to their git status.  The files' paths are the table's keys, its values are
characters (and not strings) indicating the file's git condition.  The chars map
map as follows: (the pattern is derived from 'git status --porcelain')

 * M - file is modified
 * U - file is in conflict
 * ? - file is untracked
 * ! - file is ignored
 * A - file is added to index
 * other - file is unchanged

Otherwise the behaviour is the same as `treemacs-ignored-file-predicates', in
that any one function returning t for a file means that this file will not
be rendered.

Since removing files ignored by git is the most likely use-case treemacs offers
`treemacs-is-file-git-ignored?' to quickly make this possible."

they did no exist before, the stored positions become stale, and treemacs needs
