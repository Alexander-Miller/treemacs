;;; Commentary:
;;; Module that handles uniquely associating treemacs buffers with a certain scope,
;;; like the selected frame, or (to be implemented later) the active eyebrowse or
;;; persp desktop.
;;; This is implemented using a (somewhat) OOP style with eieio and static functions,
;;; where each scope type is expected to know how to query the current scope (e.g. the
;;; selected frame) and how to set up and tear down itself (e.g. deleting a frames
;;; associated buffer when the frame is deleted)
