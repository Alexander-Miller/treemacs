;;; Commentary:
;;; Closing the gaps for filewatch- and git-modes in conjunction with magit.
;;; Specifically this package will hook into magit so as to artificially
;;; produce filewatch events for changes that treemacs would otherwise
;;; not catch, nameley the committing and (un)staging of files.
