Collapsed directories require special handling since all directories of a series
need to be put under watch so as to be notified when the collapsed structure
needs to change, but removing the file watch is not straight forward:

Assume a series of directories are collapsed into one as '/c1/c2/c3/c4' and a
new file is created in '/c1/c2'. A refresh is started and only '/c1/c2' is
collapsed now, c3 and c4 are no longer part of the treemacs view and must be
removed from the filewatch list. However the event that triggered the refresh
was one of a file being created, so it is not possible to know that c3 and c4
need to stop being watched unless one also knows that they and c2 are under file
watch because they have been collapsed.

This is why this hash is used to keep track of collapsed directories under file
watch.")

  "Minor mode to let treemacs autorefresh itself on file system changes.
Activating this mode enables treemacs to watch the files it is displaying for
changes and automatically refresh itself by means of `treemacs-refresh' when it
detects a change that it decides is relevant.

A file event is relevant for treemacs if a new file has been created or deleted
or a file has been changed and `treemacs-git-integration' is t. Events caused
by files that are ignored as per `treemacs-ignored-file-predicates' are likewise
counted as not relevant.

The refresh is not called immediately after an event was received, treemacs
instead waits `treemacs-file-event-delay'ms to see if any more files have
changed to avoid having to refresh multiple times over a short period of time.
If the treemacs buffer exists, but is not visible, a refresh will be run the
next time it is shown.

The change only applies to directories opened *after* this mode has been
activated. This means that to enable file watching in an already existing
treemacs buffer it needs to be torn down and rebuilt by calling `treemacs' or
`treemacs-projectile'.

Turning off this mode is, on the other hand, instantaneous - it will immediately
turn off all existing file watch processes and outstanding refresh actions."
